#### Data i want to record in the future
- Units & buildings locations (x,y,z,time) to create a summary of the game on the website
- Camera positions (x,y,z,time) to create POV replay of games
- What you scout, to help you not be fooled

##### What i want to record in my dream
- Orders you give to units (possible but may add lags)
- What units killed what units (possible but may add lags)
- Combat data to see how well an army is managed (possible)
- Number of kills made with nukes (not possible with base game functions AFAIK, need more research)
- What a unit destroys/Efficiency of each units (who use better booms ? who use locust the best way ? etc etc) (might be possible but very complex)
- HP of units (possible IIRC but crazy laggy)

##### What it does not
- It does not records data until the commander spawns
- It does not records data after your death either you win or loose
- It does not records data when you spectate
